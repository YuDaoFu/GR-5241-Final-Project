# GR-5241 Final Project
Columbia University GR 5241 Machine Learning Final Project

This is a general outline of what I have done in this project and details like model structure will be left in the report.  

## Description

This project mainly consists three parts:
- Part 1: Training and testing MNIST dataset by different Machine Learning Algoritms
- Part 2: Training and testing MNIST dataset by different Deep Learning Algoritms
- Part 3: Training and testing customered dataset by different Deep Learning Algoritms

### Part 1
- Visualizing training samples, standardized training data and label embedding
- Training and testing the MNIST dataset through different approach, in this case i.e. KNN, AdaBoost.M1 / C4.5 and SVM with Gaussian Kernel

### Part 2
- Training and testing the MNIST dataset through ANN and CNN
- Vistualizing the resulls from the best parameters
- Hyper-parameters tuning and test which hyper-parameters will return the best result
- Find the best model and beat the performance of SVM with Gaussian Kernel from Part 1

### Part 3
- Training and testing the customered dataset through ANN and CNN
- Vistualizing the resulls from the best parameters
- Hyper-parameters tuning and test which hyper-parameters will return the best result
- Find the best model and best performance
